# Python-Challenge
This is a repository for my module 3 Python challenge

Results that will correctly display for PyBank in terminal:
Total Months during the period
Total profit over the period of time
Average Change per month during the period
Greatest Increase change in profit from month to month
Greatest Decrease change in profit from month to month

Results that will correctly display for PyPoll in terminal:
Total Votes cast in the election
Each candidateâ€™s total votes and percent of votes 
Winner of the election

All results for PyBank and PyPoll will be exported to seperate text files

If for some reason the code won't run then when then change the following code to os.path.join("Python-Challenge", "PyBank", "Resources", "budget_data.csv")
                                                                                  os.path.join("Python-Challenge", "PyPoll", "Resources", "election_data.csv")
                                                                                  os.path.join("Python-Challenge", "PyBank", "Analysis", "Financial_Analysis.txt")
                                                                                  os.path.join("Python-Challenge", "PyPoll", "Analysis", "Voter_Analysis.txt")
The code should run without the changes above however it was suggested to me by the TA to include this just incase it doesn't work for the grader
